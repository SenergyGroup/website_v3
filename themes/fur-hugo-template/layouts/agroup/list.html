                  <h3>Strategy</h3>
                  <h3>Black Hawk County's Goals for Addressing Food Insecurity</h3>
                  <p>In our community, food security is a shared mission. Here's what Black Hawk County has established as goals and objectives to fight food insecurity, and how we are contributing to these efforts. For a deeper understanding of the plan and its details, you can click <a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/6026e5c73e800440fd7b119f/63cb062206d59a04c02f2cf1_1-Page%20Summary%202022%20CHA%20%26%20FY23-25%20CHIP.pdf">here</a> for the full report.</p>
                  <h3>Goal</h3>
                  <p>Increase equitable access to healthy foods to improve the health of Black Hawk County community members.</p>
                  <h3>Objectives</h3>
                  <p>Maintain Double Up Food Bucks: By 2025, the goal is to maintain the 2022 level redeemed in Black Hawk County (2022 baseline = $80,645).</p>
                  <p>Reduce Food Insecurity Rate: By 2025, the target is to reduce the rate for the BHC population to 9% (2020 baseline = 9.8%) and to 15.8% for Black Hawk County children under age 18 (2020 baseline = 16.8%).</p>
                  <h3>Our Contribution</h3>
                  <p>Coalition Building & Gap Analysis: We are working to "collaborate with ongoing healthy food access coalitions to document existing programs and resources." Our efforts include understanding the landscape and identifying opportunities for collaboration and improvement.</p>
                  <p>These strategies align with Black Hawk County's commitment to community health, and we're proud to be a part of this mission. Together, we're making strides toward a thriving community.</p>
