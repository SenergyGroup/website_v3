      <description>It doesnâ€™t happen often, but if a subpar item slips through our quality control checks &amp;amp; makes it to you, simply explain the issue through our contact form. We will send an immediate replacement. You will never be asked to return any items to our facility.
Replacement orders are prioritized in our production facility in order to ship as quickly as possible. We typically do not offer returns, refunds, or replacements due to user error such as incorrect selection of sizes, designs, colors, etc.</description>
