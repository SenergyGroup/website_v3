### Introduction

Food insecurity is not just a matter of hunger; it's a complex, heartbreaking issue affecting one in every ten people in Black Hawk County, Iowa. This challenge isn't limited to satisfying immediate needs; it extends to addressing underlying inequalities that shape our community. It's a battle Senergy Group is proud to fight, starting right at home.

### The Connection between Food Insecurity, Equity, and Sustainability

Have you ever wondered how deep the roots of food insecurity run? How it connects to broader social and financial issues? We've learned that people who are struggling to survive, facing trauma and food insecurity, often can't focus on broader social or financial issues. However, when we provide them with adequate support and healing, we give them an opportunity. An opportunity to channel their energy toward fighting for what they believe in, rather than fighting to survive.

Below, you'll find a map of Black Hawk County, highlighting the areas most affected by food insecurity. The overlaid data on pantries, community meals, and poverty levels provide a striking illustration of where help is most needed and why. Alongside, the graph emphasizes the percentage of food insecurity in each area, a sobering reminder of the challenges we face.
