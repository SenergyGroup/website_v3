Please review the below information to find answers to any of your questions regarding our policies.

### Shipping Services
We are partnered with OSM & UPS, offering economy, ground, 2-day, overnight, & international shipping on all of our products. Shipping prices vary based on the size/weight of the order & the shipping location. All orders ship from Detroit, MI. 

### Economy Shipping (2-6 business days)
Economy is the most cost-effective shipping method we offer. A combination of shipping services is used (based on destination) to ensure your packages are handled as efficiently as possible. It is best used with customers who aren’t in rush to get their products delivered. Transit time averages 2-6 business days within the contiguous United States.

**Economy transit times are not guaranteed & may increase during the Winter Holiday season.**

### Ground Shipping (1-5 Business Days)

Our ground shipping option is UPS Ground — transit time is displayed in business days on the map below & depends on proximity to Detroit, MI.

If your order finishes production on a Saturday or Sunday, it will be picked up by UPS on Monday & delivered in the number of business days provided in the chart below for the destination location.

**As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, UPS Ground transit estimates are not guaranteed.**

If you choose Ground Shipping for Alaska, Hawaii & Puerto Rico, you will automatically be upgraded to 2-day shipping & charged the 2-day shipping rate as Ground Service is not available to those destinations.

Orders that utilize Ground shipping cannot be delivered to a PO Box.

### Two-Day (Next Business Day)

When selecting 2-day shipping, your package will be delivered within two business days after production is complete. Delivery is performed Monday – Friday only. If your order finishes production on a Saturday or Sunday, it will be picked up by UPS on Monday & delivered on Wednesday.

Orders shipped with 2-Day shipping cannot be delivered to a PO Box.

**As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, UPS 2nd Day transit times are not guaranteed.**

Please note that if you select 2nd Day shipping when your package’s destination is in a 2-day UPS Ground zone, the order will be shipped with UPS Ground. Please review the UPS Ground zone map for details about which locations are within 2-day Ground zones.

### Overnight
Overnight shipping means your package will be delivered the next business day as soon as production is complete. Delivery performed Monday – Friday only. If your order finishes production on a Saturday or Sunday, it will be picked up by UPS on Monday & delivered on Tuesday.

These packages cannot be delivered to a PO box. 

### International
Ship time ranges from 1-4 weeks depending on proximity to Detroit, MI & the destination country’s policies related to international shipments in the wake of COVID-19. Due to the rapidly changing international shipping landscape as related to COVID-19, international transit times may be extended.
