Please review the below information to find answers to any of your questions regarding our policies.

### Shipping Services
We ship through USPS, offering standard (Ground Advantage), and priority (Priority Mail Express) for all of our products. Shipping prices vary based on the size/weight of the order & the shipping location. All orders ship from Laguna Beach, CA. 

### Standard Shipping (2-5 business days)
Our standard shipping option is USPS Ground Advantage. Standard is the most cost-effective shipping method we offer. It is best used with customers who aren’t in rush to get their products delivered. Transit time averages 2-5 business days within the contiguous United States. 

Orders that utilize Ground shipping cannot be delivered to a PO Box.

**Standard transit times are not guaranteed & may increase during the Winter Holiday season.**

### Priority Shipping (1-2 business days)

Our priority shipping option is USPS Priority Mail Express. When selecting priority shipping, your package will be delivered within two business days after production is complete. Delivery is performed Monday – Friday only. If your order finishes production on a Saturday or Sunday, it will be picked up by USPS on Monday & delivered by Wednesday.

Orders shipped with 2-Day shipping cannot be delivered to a PO Box.

**USPS guarantees 2-day delivery by 6 pm. If your package doesn't arrive by the specified time, you may be entitled to a refund. Check [here](https://www.usps.com/help/refunds.htm#pme) for more information.**
