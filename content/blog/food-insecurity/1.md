### Introduction

Food insecurity is not just a matter of hunger; it’s a multifaceted issue affecting one in every ten people in Black Hawk County, Iowa. This challenge goes beyond meeting immediate needs; it extends to addressing underlying inequalities that shape our community. It’s a battle Senergy Group is proud to lead, starting right at home.
